  I am a full stack software engineer with a strong background in JavaScript. 
  My experience includes working with technologies such as Angular and React on the front end, as well as Node.js/Express and Go on the backend.
  I have experience with micro service architectures and Docker applications as well as AWS and Kubernetes. I have used SQL, MongoDB, and Redis as data layers.
  I have a passion for products and doing whatever it takes to make a product standout and be effective.
